# Information
This is an online, web app version of the original Bars And Dots (Copyright 1989-1994, Rev 1.13) program written in MS-DOS by Sid Hollander. It uses a different format than the original program but preserves and expands on the functionality. It also uses Node.js / React / MUI framework and Webpack/Babel software. This site does not accept nor store user information. This site is also generally under construction as we add new features and frequently reassess accuracy.
