# History/Story
Original Bars & Dots author Sid Hollander and Director of Maya Exploration Center Ed Barnhart work with Pennsylvania College of Technology (Penn College) in Williamsport, PA to educate math students in Maya Math.  At the same time, there began to be a growing need to update the original Bars & Dots program.  It was currently only available on the MS-DOS operating system, requiring users to either find a emulator or keep old computers that still ran the operating system.  In addition, the interface was far behind and lacked overall accessibility.

Paths crossed when Ed and Sid reached out to Penn College in search of a student that would be willing to create a modern version of Bars & Dots.  Ethan Yoder, a Software Developer & Information Management major, accepted this project and met in Merida, Mexico where Sid resides, to plan and design this modern version of Bars & Dots.  The parties agreed on creating a web application.  This allowed the app to be available to all regardless of operating system. Ethan designed the majority of the code and layout. Matt Neel, a senior data analyst in Seattle with 
some developer experience, took over the project and managed the changes visible today.
